View Scripts. Scripts are what make all the different mechanics of the simulator work and they are located in two different directories, the first is Assets/1_SelfDrivingCar/Scripts which mostly relate to the UI and socket connections. The second directory for scripts is Assets/Standard Assets/Vehicle/Car/Scripts and they control all the different interactions with the car.

You can easily build a new track by using the prebuilt road prefabs located in Assets/RoadKit/Prefabs click and drag the road prefab pieces onto the editor, you can snap road pieces together easily by using vertex snapping by holding down "v" and dragging a road piece close to another piece.
